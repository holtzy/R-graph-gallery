# About shapefiles
***

If you did not find the geospatial data you need in existing R packages (see the [map section](map.html)), you need to find this information elsewhere on the web. 

Usually, you will find it as a *shape file* format. This format is composed by **several files** that you need to **keep together** in the same folder.


# Find and download a shapefile.
***

You need to dig the internet to find the shape file you are interested in. For instance, [this URL](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php) will redirect you to a zipped shape file containing the world boundaries.

You can download it and unzip it with R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Download the shapefile. (note that I store it in a folder called DATA. You have to change that if needed.)
download.file("http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/TM_WORLD_BORDERS_SIMPL-0.3.zip", destfile = "DATA/world_shape_file.zip")
# You now have it in your current working directory, have a look!

# Unzip this file. You can do it with R (as below), or clicking on the object you downloaded.
unzip("DATA/world_shape_file.zip", junkpaths = FALSE)
#  -- > You now have 4 files. One of these files is a .shp file! (TM_WORLD_BORDERS_SIMPL-0.3.shp)
```










# Read it with `sf`
***

The `sf` package offers the `st_read()` and the `read_sf()` functions that allows to **read shapefile** using the following syntax. 

As a result you get a geospatial object (`my_sf` here) that contains all the information we need for further mapping. Please try the following command to understand how this object works:

- `print(my_sf)`: tells you the max and min coordinates, the kind of projection in use and the the **first few rows** of the data associated with the regions.
- `nrow(my_sf)`: how many regions you have

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Read this shape file with the sf library.
library(sf)
my_sf <- read_sf("TM_WORLD_BORDERS_SIMPL-0.3.shp")

# -- > Now you have a sf object (simple feature data frame). You can start doing maps!
```



# Plot it with `base R`
***

<div class = "row">

<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12 align-self-center">

The basic `plot()` function knows how to plot a geospatial object. Thus you just need to pass it `my_sf` and add a couple of options to customize the output.

</div>


<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12">

```{r thecode4, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.height=4}
# Basic plot of this shape file:
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(st_geometry(my_sf), col = "#f2f2f2", bg = "skyblue", lwd = 0.25, border = 0)
```
</div>
</div>

```{r thecode4, eval=FALSE}
```













# Plot it with `ggplot2`
***

<div class = "row">

<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12 align-self-center">

It is totally possible (and advised) to build the map with [ggplot2](ggplot2-package.html), using the `geom_sf()` function as described below.

</div>


<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12">

```{r thecode5, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.height=4}
# Plot it
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(my_sf) +
  geom_sf(fill = "#69b3a2", color = "white") +
  theme_void()
```
</div>
</div>

```{r thecode5, eval=FALSE}
```

This post explains how to read and plot a shapefile in R.

You might be interested in how to [customize the map](169-170-basic-manipulation-of-shapefiles.html) (select regions, change colors, etc.) and more generally in the [map section](map.html).
