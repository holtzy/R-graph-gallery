This page aims to explain how to customize R treemaps. Make sure you already understood how to build a [basic treemap](234-a-very-basic-treemap.html) with R.

The first step is to control label appearance. All the options are explained in the code below. Note that you can apply a different feature to each level of the treemap, for example using white for group labels, and orange for subgroup labels.

</div>


<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12">

```{r thecode, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.height=7}
# library
library(treemap)

# Create data
group <- c(rep("group-1", 4), rep("group-2", 2), rep("group-3", 3))
subgroup <- paste("subgroup", c(1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3), sep = "-")
value <- c(13, 5, 22, 12, 11, 7, 3, 1, 23)
data <- data.frame(group, subgroup, value)

# Custom labels:
treemap(data,
    index = c("group", "subgroup"), vSize = "value", type = "index",
    fontsize.labels = c(15, 12), # size of labels. Give the size per level of aggregation: size for group, size for subgroup, sub-subgroups...
    fontcolor.labels = c("white", "orange"), # Color of labels
    fontface.labels = c(2, 1), # Font of labels: 1,2,3,4 for normal, bold, italic, bold-italic...
    bg.labels = c("transparent"), # Background color of labels
    align.labels = list(
        c("center", "center"),
        c("right", "bottom")
    ), # Where to place labels in the rectangle?
    overlap.labels = 0.5, # number between 0 and 1 that determines the tolerance of the overlap between labels. 0 means that labels of lower levels are not printed if higher level labels overlap, 1  means that labels are always printed. In-between values, for instance the default value .5, means that lower level labels are printed if other labels do not overlap with more than .5  times their area size.
    inflate.labels = F, # If true, labels are bigger when rectangle is bigger.
)
```
</div>
</div>



```{r thecode, eval=FALSE}
```










# Borders
***

<div class = "row">

<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12 align-self-center">

You can control the border:

- color with `border.col`
- width with `border.lwds`

Remember that you can still provide a vector to each option: it gives the value for groups, subgroups and so on.

</div>


<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12">

```{r thecode2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.height=7}
# Custom borders:
treemap(data,
    index = c("group", "subgroup"), vSize = "value", type = "index",
    border.col = c("black", "white"), # Color of borders of groups, of subgroups, of subsubgroups ....
    border.lwds = c(7, 2) # Width of colors
)
```
</div>
</div>



```{r thecode2, eval=FALSE}
```














# General features
***

<div class = "row">

<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12 align-self-center">

A few other arguments for more general customization. The `palette` arguments accepts any palette from `RColorBrewer`.

</div>


<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12">

```{r thecode3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.height=7}
# General features:
treemap(data,
    index = c("group", "subgroup"), vSize = "value",
    type = "index", # How you color the treemap. type help(treemap) for more info
    palette = "Set1", # Select your color palette from the RColorBrewer presets or make your own.
    title = "My Treemap", # Customize your title
    fontsize.title = 12, # Size of the title
)
```
</div>
</div>



```{r thecode3, eval=FALSE}
```
