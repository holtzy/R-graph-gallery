The `dygraphs` package allows to represent [time series](time-series.html): a chart where the X axis represent time, and the Y axis the evolution of one or several variables. 

`dygraphs` allows to make interactive charts: you can zoom on a specific time period, hover a data point to have more info, and more. Two input format are possible for the time variable: 

- `numeric`: like 1,2,3,4,5
- `date`: like 2017/12/08
 
You can check at which your format your time variable is with `str(data)`.
 
 
 
 
 
# If time is a `numeric` variable
***

That's the simplest use case. Just make sure that time is displayed on the first column of the data frame.

Here is a code example and the resulting chart:

 
<center><iframe src="HtmlWidget/dygraphs316-1.html" height="300" width="100%" style="border:none;"></iframe></center>

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Library
library(dygraphs)
 
# --- Format 1: time is represented by a simple number. (must be numeric and ordered)
data <- data.frame( 
  time=c( seq(0,20,0.5), 40), 
  value=runif(42)
)

# Double check time is numeric
str(data)

# Use dygraph
p <- dygraph(data)
p
```








# If time is a `date` variable
***

The process is slightly more complicated with the `date` format. 

- First, check time is indeed recognized as a date by R with `str(data)`. This gives the format of each column, so check that `Date` is written. 

- Second, transform the data frame to the `xts` format (xts=eXtensible Time Series). This is requested by dygraphs.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(dygraphs)
library(xts) # To make the convertion data-frame / xts format
 
# Format 2: time is represented by a date.
data <- data.frame(
  time=seq(from=Sys.Date()-40, to=Sys.Date(), by=1 ), 
  value=runif(41)
)
 
# Your time column MUST be a time format!, check it out with str()
str(data)
 
# Then you can create the xts format, and thus use dygraph
don <- xts(x = data$value, order.by = data$time)

# Make the chart
p <- dygraph(don)
p
```
















# Several series
***

The process to plot several variables is very close. When you do the transformation to the `xts` format, simply specify all the columns you want to keep on your chart

<center><iframe src="HtmlWidget/dygraphs316-3.html" height="300" width="100%" style="border:none;"></iframe></center>

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(dygraphs)
library(xts) # To make the convertion data-frame / xts format

# Format 3: Several variables for each date
data <- data.frame(
  time=seq(from=Sys.Date()-40, to=Sys.Date(), by=1 ), 
  value1=runif(41), 
  value2=runif(41)+0.7
)

# Then you can create the xts format:
don=xts( x=data[,-1], order.by=data$time)

# Chart
p <- dygraph(don)
p

# save the widget
# library(htmlwidgets)
# saveWidget(p, file=paste0( getwd(), "/HtmlWidget/dygraphs316-3.html"))
```




# Getting the date format
***

The hardest part in time series visualization is to get your data at the `date` format! 

This can be a real struggle. Fortunately the `lubridate` package is here to make your life easier. Have a look to its documentation [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html).

Most of the time data is available at text format (like from excel spreadsheet). When you load these data you get a `character` format. You want to transform it in a `date`, `time` or `date-time` format. A set of functions with relevant names exist for that. Here is an example of utilisation on a real dataset:
 
 
<center><iframe src="HtmlWidget/dygraphs316-4.html" height="300" width="100%" style="border:none;"></iframe></center>

```{r eval=FALSE}
# libraries
library(dygraphs)
library(xts) # To make the convertion data-frame / xts format
library(lubridate) # You will love it to work with dates
library(tidyverse)
 
# Load the data (hosted on the gallery website)
path = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/R-graph-gallery/master/DATA/bike.csv'
path = 'DATA/bike.csv'
data <- read.table(path, header=T, sep=",")
 
# Check the format, it is not a date yet !
str(data)
 
# The wanna-be-date column looks like that: "2011-02-19 02:00:00". This is Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second. Thus I can transform it with the function: ymd_hms
data$datetime <- ymd_hms(data$datetime)
 
# Check if it worked properly!
str(data)
 
# It does! Let's go to the its format like seen above, and make the dygraph
don <- xts(x = data$count, order.by = data$datetime)

# Chart
p <- dygraph(don)
p

# save the widget
# library(htmlwidgets)
# saveWidget(p, file=paste0( getwd(), "/HtmlWidget/dygraphs316-4.html"))
```


As a memo, here is an overview of the function that exist:

- `ymd(“20110604”)`
- `mdy(“06-04-2011”)`
- `dmy(“04/06/2011”)`
- `ymd_hms(“2011-06-04 12:00:00”)`
