# Packages
***

For this post, we need to install and load the [beeswarm](https://github.com/aroneklund/beeswarm) package. 

We can install it from CRAN using `install.packages("beeswarm")`. Then, we can load it:

```{r}
# install.packages("beeswarm")
library(beeswarm)
```

<br/>


# Dataset
***

Since [beeswarm](beeswarm.html) plots are made to visualize **individual data points**, we need a dataset that contains numerical values. Here, we'll use the `iris` dataset, which is a built-in dataset in R.

We can easily load it:

```{r}
data(iris)
```



# Change dots color
***

The package comes with a `beeswarm()` function, and thanks to its `col` argument, we can change the color of the dots. Here, we'll use the `blue` color.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
beeswarm(
  iris$Sepal.Length,
  col="blue"
)
```



# Change dots symbol
***

The `pch` argument allows to change the symbol of the dots. Here, we'll use the `16` symbol since it's the same as before but filled.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
beeswarm(
  iris$Sepal.Length,
  pch=16
)
```



# Change dots size
***

The `cex` argument allows to change the size of the dots. Here, we'll use a `2.5` size (default is 1).

```{r, echo=TRUE}
beeswarm(
  iris$Sepal.Length,
  cex=2.5
)
```


# Change dots position
***

The `method` argument allows to **change the position of the dots**. Here are the available **options**:

- `swarm` (default): the dots are placed randomly, but they don't overlap.
- `center`: the dots are symetrically placed around the center of the plot.
- `hex`: the dots are placed on a hexagonal grid.
- `square`: the dots are placed on a square grid.

In our case, we'll use the `center` method:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
beeswarm(
  iris$Sepal.Length,
  method="center",
  cex=2 # make the dots bigger
)
```
