# Packages
***

For this post, we need to install and load the [ggbeeswarm](package/ggbeeswarm.html) package. 

We can install it from CRAN using `install.packages("ggbeeswarm")`. Then, we can load it:

```{r}
# install.packages("ggbeeswarm")
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(ggplot2)
```

<br/>


# Dataset
***

Since [beeswarm](beeswarm.html) plots are made to visualize **individual data points**, we need a dataset that contains numerical values. Here, we'll use the `iris` dataset, which is a built-in dataset in R.

We can easily load it:

```{r}
data(iris)
```



# Grouped beeswarm
***

We can easily create a **grouped beeswarm plot** by specifying a categorical variable in the `aes()` function.


```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(iris,aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_beeswarm()
```



# Color by group
***

And in order to make the **plot more readable**, we can add some **color** to the points using the `colour` argument.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(iris,aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length, colour=Species)) +
  geom_beeswarm()
```



# Customize colors
***

We can also **customize the colors** using the `scale_color_manual()` function. And thanks to the `theme_minimal()` function, we can make the plot a bit **more elegant**.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(iris,aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length, colour=Species)) +
  geom_beeswarm() +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9")) +
  theme_minimal()
```
