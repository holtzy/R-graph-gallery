PROCESSED SRTM DATA VERSION 4.1

The data  distributed here  are in  ARC GRID,  ARC ASCII  and Geotiff format, in
decimal degrees and datum WGS84.  They are derived from the USGS/NASA SRTM data.
CIAT  have  processed  this  data  to  provide  seamless  continuous  topography
surfaces.  Areas with  regions of no  data in the  original SRTM data  have been
filled using interpolation methods described by Reuter et al. (2007).

Version 4.1 has the following enhancements over V4.0:
- Improved ocean mask used, which includes some small islands  previously  being 
  lost in the cut data.
- Single no-data line of pixels along meridians fixed.
- All GeoTiffs with 6000 x 6000 pixels.
- For ASCII format files the projection definition is included in .prj files.
- For GeoTiff format files the projection definition is in the .tfw  (ESRI TIFF 
  World) and a .hdr file that reports PROJ.4 equivelent projection definitions.
