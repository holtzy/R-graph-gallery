The [circlize](package/circlize.html) package allows to create chord diagrams with R. It accepts two types of input formats: either a matrix showing the strength of connections between pairs of nodes, or a data frame listing the relationships.

The `chordDiagram()` function from circlize creates the visualization with entities arranged in a circle, connected by ribbons whose width represents the strength of their relationship. The function offers extensive customization options for colors, transparency, and other visual properties. Find a full documentation [here](https://jokergoo.github.io/circlize_book/book/the-chorddiagram-function.html).

<u>Note</u>: The [circlize](package/circlize.html) package is a project by [Zuguang Gu](https://github.com/jokergoo). Here, we will use a matrix where each cell represents how many times one character mentions another character in The Office. This example comes from  [Ansgar Wolsing](https://github.com/bydata/30DayChartChallenge/blob/main/2023/17/17-network-the-office-mentions.R).

# Data Preparation: 
## Processing Character Mentions from The Office

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)      # Data manipulation and visualization
library(ggtext)         # Text formatting in ggplot2
library(tidytext)       # Text mining tools
library(here)           # File path management
library(circlize)       # Circular visualization
library(schrute)        # The Office dataset

# Set base path for output files
base_path <- here("faceted-chord-diagram")

# Clean and standardize character names in the dataset
theoffice <- theoffice %>% 
  mutate(
    character = str_remove_all(character, "[\":]"),      # Remove quotes and colons
    character = str_remove_all(character, "\\\""),       # Remove escaped quotes
    character = case_match(
      character,
      "(Pam's mom) Heleen" ~ "Pam's mom",
      "AJ" ~ "A.J.",
      "abe" ~ "Gabe",
      .default = character
    )) 

# Get top 10 characters by number of lines
top_character_names <- theoffice %>% 
  count(character, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  pull(character)

# Create dataset of character mentions
theoffice_mentions <- 
  theoffice %>% 
  filter(character %in% top_character_names) %>%         # Keep only top 10 characters
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "words", to_lower = FALSE) %>%  # Split text into words
  filter(word %in% top_character_names) %>%             # Keep only mentions of top characters
  # Convert characters to ordered factors
  mutate(
    character = factor(character, levels = top_character_names),
    character_mentioned = factor(word, levels = top_character_names)) %>% 
  select(index, season, episode, character, character_mentioned)

# Aggregate mentions and create complete matrix
theoffice_mentions_agg <- theoffice_mentions %>% 
  group_by(character, character_mentioned) %>% 
  summarize(
    total_mentions = n(),                               # Count total mentions
    mentions_lines = n_distinct(index),                 # Count unique lines with mentions
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>% 
  # Ensure all character combinations exist (including zeros)
  complete(character, character_mentioned, fill = list(total_mentions = 0, mentions_lines = 0)) %>% 
  arrange(character, character_mentioned)
```

# Creating the Basic Chord Diagram 

This code creates our first chord diagram showing character interactions in The Office. We first convert our aggregated data into a matrix format required by the `chordDiagram()` function, then set up a custom color palette. The diagram is rendered using `ragg` for high-quality output, with carefully chosen visual parameters like transparency and border width to ensure readability.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
# Create a square matrix from mentions data, with character names as row and column names
mat <- matrix(theoffice_mentions_agg$total_mentions, ncol = length(top_character_names))
rownames(mat) <- top_character_names
colnames(mat) <- top_character_names

# Define color palette for characters and background
pal_office <- 
  c("#FBA93A", "#cc2d36", "#93BFE5", "#D8ACD8", "#f0813c", "#F0F4EC", "#2AA3A6",
    "#4BD9EF", "#4bad6d", "#5D77AA")
bg_color <- colorspace::darken("#435774", 0.2)


# Create and save the chord diagram
ragg::agg_png(here(base_path, "17-network-the-office-mentions.png"),
              res = 500, width = 8, height = 8, units = "in", bg = bg_color)
par(
  family = "Outfit", cex = 2, col = "white", # font family, size, color
  bg = bg_color, 
  mai = rep(0.5, 4) # plot margin in inches
) 
chordDiagram(mat, transparency = 0.3, 
             grid.col = pal_office[1:10], # assign colors to each character
             link.border = "white", link.lwd = 0.2, # add thin white borders to connections
             annotationTrack = c("name", "grid"), # show only name and grid tracks (excluding axis)
             annotationTrackHeight = mm_h(c(3, 5)),
             link.largest.ontop = TRUE
)
title(
  main = "Who speaks about whom?",
  sub = "top 10 characters in The Office\nSource: {schrute} R package. Visualisation: Ansgar Wolsing",
  col.main = "white", cex.main = 1.3)
invisible(dev.off())

# Creating Individual Character-Focused Diagrams

Here we create a custom function to generate individual chord diagrams, each highlighting a specific character's interactions. The function applies unique coloring to emphasize the focal character while de-emphasizing others. We then use this function in a loop to create a 3x3 facet of diagrams, one for each of the top 9 characters, offering a detailed view of each character's mention patterns.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
# Define function to create individual chord diagrams for each character
plot_chordDiagram <- function(name, rank, color = NULL) {
  # Set up colors for current character's diagram
  row_colors <- rep("#EEEEEE33", 10)     # Default transparent gray for all rows
  stopifnot(rank <= length(pal_office))   # Ensure rank is valid
  row_colors[rank] <- pal_office[rank]    # Highlight current character's row
  
  # Set up grid colors
  grid_colors <- alpha(pal_office, 0.2)   # Set base transparency for all segments
  stopifnot(rank <= length(pal_office))   # Ensure rank is valid
  grid_colors[rank] <- pal_office[rank]   # Highlight current character's segment
  
  # Create chord diagram
  chordDiagram(mat,
             grid.col = grid_colors,      # Assign segment colors
             # Optional: Add thin white borders around connections
             # link.border = "white", 
             # link.lwd = 0.1,
             annotationTrack = c("name", "grid"), # show only name and grid tracks (excluding axis)
             annotationTrackHeight = mm_h(c(2, 2)),
             link.largest.ontop = TRUE,
             row.col = row_colors         # Assign row colors
  )
  title(main = name, col.main = "white", cex.main = 1.3)  # Add character name as title
}

# Set up output file for faceted plot
filepath_facets_chart <- here(base_path, "17-network-the-office-mentions-facets.png")
ragg::agg_png(filepath_facets_chart,
              res = 500, width = 10, height = 10, units = "in", bg = bg_color)

# Set up 3x3 plot grid with formatting parameters
par(
  mfrow = c(3, 3),                       # Arrange plots in 3x3 grid
  family = "Outfit", cex = 0.8, col = "white", # Font family, size, color
  bg = bg_color, 
  mai = rep(0.5, 4)                      # Set uniform margins
) 

# Create individual chord diagrams for first 9 characters
for (i in 1:9) {
  plot_chordDiagram(top_character_names[i], i)  
}

# Save the plot
invisible(dev.off())

```

# Adding Title and Annotations to the Final Visualization

This final code block uses the [magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) package to add professional finishing touches to our visualization. We extend the canvas to accommodate text elements, then add a main title, an explanatory subtitle, and source information. The annotations are carefully positioned and styled using appropriate fonts and sizes to create a polished graphic.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
# Load magick package for image manipulation
library(magick)

# Read the generated chart
img_chart <- image_read(filepath_facets_chart) 
img_chart_info <- image_info(img_chart)

# Calculate new dimensions to add space for titles (11% taller)
img_new_geometry <- sprintf("%sx%s", img_chart_info$height, 1.11 * img_chart_info$height)

# Add text elements to the chart
img_chart %>% 
  # Extend canvas vertically while maintaining aspect ratio
  image_extent(img_new_geometry, gravity = "south", color = bg_color) %>% 
  
  # Add main title at the top
  image_annotate("Who speaks about whom in The Office",
                 gravity = "north", size = 200, color = "white", 
                 font = "American Typewriter") %>% 
  
  # Add explanatory subtitle below main title
  image_annotate("The width of the connecting lines indicates how often a character
  mentions another character's name",
                 location = "+0+250",     # Position 250 pixels from top
                 gravity = "north", size = 100, color = "white", 
                 font = "Outfit") %>% 
  
  # Add source attribution at bottom
  image_annotate("Source: {schrute} R package. Visualisation: Ansgar Wolsing",
                 location = "+0+50",      # Position 50 pixels from bottom
                 gravity = "south", size = 80, color = "white", font = "Outfit") %>% 
  
  # Save final image
  image_write(here(base_path, "17-network-who-speaks-office.png"))

# Display the final image in R Markdown
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/holtzy/R-graph-gallery/blob/master/character-interaction-analysis/17-network-who-speaks-office.png?raw=true")
