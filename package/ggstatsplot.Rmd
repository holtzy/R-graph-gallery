# Quick start
***
The `ggstatsplot` package in R is an extension of the [ggplot2](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) package, designed to facilitate the creation of visualizations **accompanied by relevant statistical details**. 


<div class = "row">

<div class = "col-md-5  col-sm-12 align-self-center">

It streamlines the process of **integrating statistical tests** with informative plots, making it easier for researchers and data analysts to communicate their findings effectively.

# Installation
***
Getting started with `ggstatsplot` is straightforward. 

First, ensure you have `ggplot2` installed. Then, you can install `ggstatsplot` directly from CRAN using the `install.packages` function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("waffle", repos = "https://cinc.rud.is")
```





# Basic usage 
***

The `ggstatsplot` package comes with about **9 functions**, each of them targeting a **specific statistical test**.

For instance, the `ggscatterstats()` function visualizes the relationship between 2 variables `x` and `y` using a [scatterplot](https://r-graph-gallery.com/scatterplot.html). It runs a **linear regression** and draw a regression line that provides a visual representation of the linear relationship between the two variables. The shaded region around it represents the **confidence interval**.

The **marginal histograms** on the top and right side of the plot show the distribution of the `x` and `y` variables, respectively. Additionally, the plot provides statistical details like **correlation coefficient**, **p-value**, and **sample size**.

Here is an example using the famous `mtcars` dataset, checking the relationship between the `hp` and `mpg` columns:

```{r}
ggscatterstats(data = mtcars, x = hp, y = mpg)
```

Now, let's try to summarize the power of `ggstatsplot` through its main functions:





# Key features
***

Here is an overview of the main function offered by ggstatsplot with a short description of what they do:

## &rarr; ggbetweenstats
`ggbetweenstats()` creates [violin plots](https://r-graph-gallery.com/violin.html) for comparisons between groups or conditions, accompanied by results from statistical tests.

Example:

```{r}
ggstatsplot::ggbetweenstats(data = mtcars, x = am, y = mpg, type = "p")
```



## &rarr; ggwithinstats
`ggwithinstats()` is used to display data distributions, descriptive statistics, and statistical tests for different groups within the same variable. 

The function is particularly useful for visualizing and testing differences **within** a single categorical variable.

Here's a simple example using the mtcars dataset that comes built-in with R:

```{r}
ggwithinstats(
  data = bugs_long,
  x = condition,
  y = desire,
  type = "nonparametric", ## type of statistical test
  xlab = "Condition", ## label for the x-axis
  ylab = "Desire to kill an artrhopod", ## label for the y-axis
  package = "yarrr", ## package from which color palette is to be taken
  palette = "info2", ## choosing a different color palette
  title = "Comparison of desire to kill bugs",
  caption = "Source: Ryan et al., 2013"
) + ## modifying the plot further
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 10),
    breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 1)
  )
```



## &rarr; gghistostats

`gghistostats()` generates histograms to visualize the distribution of a numeric variable and checks if its mean is significantly different from a specified value with a one-sample test:

```{r}
gghistostats(
  data       = ggplot2::msleep,
  x          = awake,
  title      = "Amount of time spent awake",
  test.value = 12,
  binwidth   = 1
)
```

## &rarr; Other functions

Several other functions are available:
- `ggdotplotstats()` &rarr; Similar to `gghistostats()`, but intended for labeled numeric variables.

- `ggscatterstats()` &rarr; Creates a scatterplot with marginal distributions overlaid on the axes and results from statistical tests in the subtitle.

- `ggcorrmat()` &rarr; Produces a correlalogram (a matrix of correlation coefficients) with statistical details.

- `ggpiestats()` &rarr; Creates a pie chart for categorical or nominal variables with results from contingency table analysis included in the subtitle.

- `ggbarstats()` &rarr; An alternative to `ggpiestats()`, this function creates bar charts for categorical data with associated statistical tests.

- `ggcoefstats()` &rarr; Generates dot-and-whisker plots for regression models and meta-analysis.

Those functions are described more in depth in other pages of the R graph gallery.
