# About
***

The chart we want to reproduce is a [dumbell barplot](https://r-graph-gallery.com/barplot.html) about the **number of shares and losses** of the teams with the highest number of Bundesliga matches.

It has been created by [Cédric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/). Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here!

As a teaser, here's the chart we want to reproduce:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="img/graph/web-dumbell-chart-original.png" alt="Dumbbell Chart" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto;">
</div>

# Libraries

In order to create this chart, we will use the following libraries:


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggtext)
library(scales)
library(prismatic)
```


# Data

The data used for this chart can be created as follows:
  
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df_matches <- 
  tibble(
    team = c("FC Bayern München", "SV Werder Bremen", "Borussia Dortmund", "VfB Stuttgart", 
             "Borussia M'gladbach", "Hamburger SV", "Eintracht Frankfurt",
             "FC Schalke 04", "1. FC Köln", "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"),
    matches = c(2000, 1992, 1924, 1924, 1898, 1866, 1856, 1832, 1754, 1524),
    won =     c(1206,  818,  881,  782,  763,  746,  683,  700,  674,  669),
    lost =    c( 363,  676,  563,  673,  636,  625,  693,  669,  628,  447)
  ) |> 
  mutate(team = fct_rev(fct_inorder(team))) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(team, matches),
    names_to = "type",
    values_to = "result"
  ) |> 
  mutate(share = result / matches) |> 
  arrange(team, -share) |> 
  mutate(is_smaller = if_else(row_number() == 1, 0, 1), .by = team)

## number of not-Bayern teams for emphasis later
n <- length(unique(df_matches$team)) - 1
```



# Set up parameters for the chart
***

Before starting to actually create the chart, we need to set up some parameters that will be used later on such as colors and annotations.

### Colors

Let's define the **colors** that we will use for the chart. We will use the `clr_darken()` function from the `prismatic` package to create a **darker version** of the base color.

```{r}
pal_base <- c("#EFAC00", "#28A87D")
pal_dark <- clr_darken(pal_base, .25)

grey_base <- "grey50"
grey_dark <- "grey25"
```

### Theme

We will use the `theme_minimal()` theme from the `ggplot2` package. We will then update it to match the style of the chart.

Here are the main parameters that we will update:

- `base_family` and `base_size` to set the **font family** and **size** for the whole chart

- `axis.title` to **remove the axis** titles

- `axis.text.y` to set the **horizontal alignment** of the y-axis labels

- `panel.grid.minor` and `panel.grid.major` to **remove the grid lines**

- `plot.title` and `plot.caption` to set the title and caption of the chart

- `plot.margin` to set the **margins** of the chart

- `plot.background` to set the **background** color of the chart

- `legend.position` to remove the **legend**

```{r}
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_family = "sans", base_size = 22))
theme_update(
  axis.title = element_blank(),
  axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0, color = grey_dark),
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
  plot.title = element_textbox_simple(
    size = rel(1.25), face = "plain", lineheight = 1.05, 
    fill = "transparent", width = unit(8, "inches"), box.color = "transparent", 
    margin = margin(0, 0, 35, 0), hjust = 0, halign = 0
  ),
  plot.caption = element_markdown(
    size = rel(.5), color = grey_base, hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 20, b = 0),
    family = 'sans'
  ),
  plot.title.position = "plot",
  plot.caption.position = "plot",
  plot.margin = margin(25, 25, 15, 25),
  plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"),
  legend.position = "none"
)
```

### Annotations

And then we define the main annotations of the chart, using the `paste0()` function that basically concatenates strings.

```{r}
title <- paste0(
  "Among the ten teams with the most Bundesliga matches, <b>Bayern Munich has the <b style='color:",
  pal_dark[1], ";'>lowest loss</b> and <b style='color:", pal_dark[2], ";'>highest win</b> rates</b>"
)

caption <- paste0(
  "<b>Graphic: Cédric Scherer • Source: kicker.de<br><br></b>Teams are ranked according to the number of ",
  "Bundesliga matches they have played so far"
)

callout <- paste0(
  "<b>Frankfurt</b> is the only team listed<br>that <b style='color:", pal_dark[1],
  ";'>lost more games (37.3%)</b><br>than <b style='color:", pal_dark[2], ";'>they have won (36.8%)</b>"
)
```



# Dumbell chart

Now let's actually create the chart. Here is what the code mainly does:

- **Layers**: the chart is built using several layers such as `geom_point()`, `geom_text()`, `stat_summary()`, `geom_richtext()`, etc.

- **Scales**: the `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_color_manual()` functions are used to set the x-axis and the colors of the chart

- **Labels**: the `labs()` function is used to set the title and caption of the chart

- **Theme**: the `theme()` function is used to set the theme of the chart

```{r}
n <- length(unique(df_matches$team)) - 1

p = ggplot(df_matches, aes(x = share, y = team)) +
    
    ## dumbbell segments
    stat_summary(
      geom = "linerange", fun.min = "min", fun.max = "max",
      linewidth = c(rep(.8, n), 1.2), color = c(rep(grey_base, n), grey_dark)
    ) +
    
    ## dumbbell points
    ## white point to overplot line endings
    geom_point(
      aes(x = share), size = 6, shape = 21, stroke = 1, color = "white", fill = "white"
    ) +
    ## semi-transparent point fill
    geom_point(
      aes(x = share, fill = type), size = 6, shape = 21, stroke = 1, color = "white", alpha = .7
    ) +
    ## point outline
    geom_point(
      aes(x = share), size = 6, shape = 21, stroke = 1, color = "white", fill = NA
    ) +
    
    ## result labels
    geom_text(
      aes(label = percent(share, accuracy = 1, prefix = "    ", suffix = "%    "), 
          x = share -0.02, hjust = is_smaller-0.32, color = type),
      fontface = c(rep("plain", n*2), rep("bold", 2)),
      family = "sans", size = 4.2
    ) +
    
    ## legend labels
    annotate(
      geom = "text", x = c(.18, .60), y = n + 1.8, 
      label = c("matches lost", "matches won"), family = "sans", 
      fontface = "bold", color = pal_base, size = 5, hjust = .5
    ) +
    
    ## call-out Eintracht
    geom_richtext(
      aes(x = .46, y = 3.3, label = callout), stat = "unique",
      family = "sans", size = 4, lineheight = 1.2,
      color = grey_base, hjust = 0, vjust = 1.03, fill = NA, label.color = NA
    ) +
    annotate(
      geom = "curve", x = .51, xend = .43, y = 3.3, yend = 4, curvature = .35, 
      angle = 60, color = grey_base, linewidth = .4, 
      arrow = arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(.08, "inches"))
    ) +
    
    coord_cartesian(clip = "off") +
    scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(add = c(.035, .05)), guide = "none") +
    scale_y_discrete(expand = expansion(add = c(.35, 1))) +
    scale_color_manual(values = pal_dark) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = pal_base) +
    labs(title = title, caption = caption) +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_text(face = c(rep("plain", n), "bold"), size=14))
ggsave("img/graph/web-dumbell-chart.png", width = 8.5, height = 7, dpi = 600)
```

The version we reproduced is slightly different from the original one. We used different fonts, which makes it easier to reproduce.
