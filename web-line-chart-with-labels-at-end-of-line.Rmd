# About
***

This page showcases the work of [Cedric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com),
built for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) initiative. 
You can find the original code on his github repository [here](https://github.com/z3tt/TidyTuesday/blob/master/R/2020_52_BigMacIndex.Rmd).

Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here! Thanks also to 
[Tomás Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who split the original code 
into this step-by-step guide!

This is what we're gonna build

</center>

Note the pretty sweet labels at the end of each lines. That's definitely the most readable way to add labels on a line chart. Much better than the usual unordered legend!


# Load packages
***

As usual, it is first necessary to load some packages before building the figure.
Today's chart is going to use the help of [ggrepel](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/articles/examples.html) 
and [`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/index.html). `ggrepel` will make it
extremely easy to automatically position labels and `ggtext` is going to make
it possible to use annotations that mix normal text with italic and bold text.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggtext)

library(showtext)
font_add_google("Lato")
showtext_auto()
```

You can read more about the showtext package on this [dedicated post](custom-fonts-in-R-and-ggplot2.html).

# Load and prepare the dataset
***

Today's chart visualizes the price changes (in USD) of a Big Mac based on a 2008
as index year. The original source of the data is 
[TheEconomist](https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data), but this post is 
based on the version released for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) 
initiative on the week of 2020-12-22. You can find the original announcement and
more information about the data [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-12-22).

```{r}
df_mac_raw <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-12-22/big-mac.csv')
```

<br>

Once the data is loaded, it's time to get the data ready for the plot.

```{r}
df_mac <- df_mac_raw %>% 
  # Extract year
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) %>% 
  # Subset variables
  select(date, year, iso_a3, currency_code, name, dollar_price) %>% 
  # If there is more than one record per year/country, use the mean 
  group_by(iso_a3, name, year) %>% 
  summarize(price = mean(dollar_price)) %>% 
  # Keep countries/regions with records for the last 21 years  
  # (from 2000 to 2020 inclusive)
  group_by(iso_a3) %>% 
  filter(n() == 21)

# Also define the group of countries that are going to be highlighted
highlights <- c("EUZ", "CHE", "DNK", "SWE", "BRA", "ARG", "GBR", "USA")
n <- length(highlights)
```

<br>

Next, it is important to make sure the plot only shows countries that have a 
Big Mac Index for 2008, the base year. The `price_index` for a given country
at a certain moment is the difference between the `price` at that moment
and the price for that country in 2008.

```{r}
countries <- df_mac %>% 
  filter(year == 2008) %>% 
  pull(iso_a3)
  
df_mac_indexed_2008 <- df_mac %>% 
  # Keep countries that have a record for 2008, the index year.
  group_by(iso_a3) %>%
  filter(iso_a3 %in% countries) %>% 
  # Compute the `price_index`
  mutate(
    ref_year = 2008,
    price_index = price[which(year == 2008)],
    price_rel = price - price_index,
    # Create 'group', used to color the lines.
    group = if_else(iso_a3 %in% highlights, iso_a3, "other"),
    group = as.factor(group)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    group = fct_relevel(group, "other", after = Inf),
    name_lab = if_else(year == 2020, name, NA_character_)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

# Theme definition
***

In this occasion, the theme is defined before creating the plot. Have a look 
at the comments within the code below to have a better understanding of what's 
going on here.

```{r}
# This theme extends the 'theme_minimal' that comes with ggplot2.
# The "Lato" font is used as the base font. This is similar
# to the original font in Cedric's work, Avenir Next Condensed.
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_family = "Lato"))


theme_update(
  # Remove title for both x and y axes
  axis.title = element_blank(),
  # Axes labels are grey
  axis.text = element_text(color = "grey40"),
  # The size of the axes labels are different for x and y.
  axis.text.x = element_text(size = 20, margin = margin(t = 5)),
  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 17, margin = margin(r = 5)),
  # Also, the ticks have a very light grey color
  axis.ticks = element_line(color = "grey91", size = .5),
  # The length of the axis ticks is increased.
  axis.ticks.length.x = unit(1.3, "lines"),
  axis.ticks.length.y = unit(.7, "lines"),
  # Remove the grid lines that come with ggplot2 plots by default
  panel.grid = element_blank(),
  # Customize margin values (top, right, bottom, left)
  plot.margin = margin(20, 40, 20, 40),
  # Use a light grey color for the background of both the plot and the panel
  plot.background = element_rect(fill = "grey98", color = "grey98"),
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey98", color = "grey98"),
  # Customize title appearence
  plot.title = element_text(
    color = "grey10", 
    size = 28, 
    face = "bold",
    margin = margin(t = 15)
  ),
  # Customize subtitle appearence
  plot.subtitle = element_markdown(
    color = "grey30", 
    size = 16,
    lineheight = 1.35,
    margin = margin(t = 15, b = 40)
  ),
  # Title and caption are going to be aligned
  plot.title.position = "plot",
  plot.caption.position = "plot",
  plot.caption = element_text(
    color = "grey30", 
    size = 13,
    lineheight = 1.2, 
    hjust = 0,
    margin = margin(t = 40) # Large margin on the top of the caption.
  ),
  # Remove legend
  legend.position = "none"
)
```
<br>

Have you ever seen the `element_markdown()` in `plot.subtitle()` above? That
function comes with the `ggtext()` package and makes it possible to use markdown
syntax to format the text. It's like magic!

# Basic chart
***

Today's chart is a lineplot that visualizes the price changes (in USD) of a Big 
Mac based on a 2008 as index year. The countries in the vector `highlights` 
have different colors to stand out from the rest and make it easier to track 
their evolution along time. Sounds quite exciting, let's get started!

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=12, out.width="100%"}
plt <- ggplot(
  # The ggplot object has associated the data for the highlighted countries
  df_mac_indexed_2008 %>% filter(group != "other"), 
  aes(year, price_rel, group = iso_a3)
) + 
  # Geometric annotations that play the role of grid lines
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = seq(2000, 2020, by = 5),
    color = "grey91", 
    size = .6
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    data = tibble(y = seq(-4, 3, by = 1), x1 = 2000, x2 = 2020),
    aes(x = x1, xend = x2, y = y, yend = y),
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    color = "grey91",
    size = .6
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    data = tibble(y = 0, x1 = 2000, x2 = 2020),
    aes(x = x1, xend = x2, y = y, yend = y),
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    color = "grey60",
    size = .8
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    aes(xintercept = ref_year), 
    color = "grey40",
    linetype = "dotted",
    size = .8
  ) +
  ## Lines for the non-highlighted countries
  geom_line(
    data = df_mac_indexed_2008 %>% filter(group == "other"),
    color = "grey75",
    size = .6,
    alpha = .5
  ) +
  ## Lines for the highlighted countries.
  # It's important to put them after the grey lines
  # so the colored ones are on top
  geom_line(
    aes(color = group),
    size = .9
  )
plt
```
<br>

That's a pretty good start! Having different colors for some countries definetely 
makes it much easier to track their price index evolution.

# Add non-overlapping labels
***

Although colors are a tremendous help, they don't reveal which country the lines
represent. Wouldn't it be nice to have a label on the end of each line that 
tells which country it represents?

It is pretty challenging to add many labels on a plot since labels tend to 
overlap each other, making the figure unreadable. Fortunately, the `ggrepel`
package is here to help us. It provides an algorithm that will automatically 
place the labels for us. Let's do it!

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=12, out.width="100%"}
plt <- plt + 
  annotate(
    "text", x = 2008.15, y = -3.35, 
    label = "2008",
    family = "Lato",
    size = 8,
    color = "grey40",
    hjust = 0
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    aes(color = group, label = name_lab),
    family = "Lato",
    fontface = "bold",
    size = 8,
    direction = "y",
    xlim = c(2020.8, NA),
    hjust = 0,
    segment.size = .7,
    segment.alpha = .5,
    segment.linetype = "dotted",
    box.padding = .4,
    segment.curvature = -0.1,
    segment.ncp = 3,
    segment.angle = 20
  ) +
  ## coordinate system + scales
  coord_cartesian(
    clip = "off",
    ylim = c(-4, 3)
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    expand = c(0, 0),
    limits = c(2000, 2023.5), 
    breaks = seq(2000, 2020, by = 5)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    expand = c(0, 0),
    breaks = seq(-4, 3, by = 1),
    labels = glue::glue("{format(seq(-4, 3, by = 1), nsmall = 2)}$")
  )
plt 
```
<br>

Wonderful! It's amazing how a few annotations can hugely improve the 
readability of the plot. 

# Final chart
***

The chart above is pretty close from being publication ready. What's needed now 
is a better color palette to improve the appearence of the plot and a good 
annotations to make the chart more insightful:

```{r, fig.width=20, fig.height=12, out.width="100%"}
plt <- plt + 
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c(rcartocolor::carto_pal(n = n, name = "Bold")[1:n-1], "grey50")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Compared to the financial crisis in 2008, how much more or less do you have to pay for a Big Mac today?",
    subtitle = "The <i>index chart</i> visualizes the price changes (in USD) of a Big Mac based on a 2008 as index year. The <b>Big Mac Index</b> is published by The Economist as an informal way to provide a test of the<br>extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It <i>seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible</i> and takes its name from the Big Mac,<br>a hamburger sold at McDonald's restaurants.",
    caption = "Visualization by Cédric Scherer  •  Data by The Economist  •  The index chart shows the 27 countries that provide Big mac prices for all years from 2000 to 2020. In case a country was reported twice per year, the mean value was visualized."
  )
plt
```
<br>

Finally, note the `<i>`, `<b>`, and `<br>` tags. It's `ggtext` the one who makes
that possible. It's fantastic!
