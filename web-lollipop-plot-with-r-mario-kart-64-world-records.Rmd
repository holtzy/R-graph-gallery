## Package and Theme
***

We start by loading the packages needed to build the figure. From all the 
packages we use, [`ragg`](https://ragg.r-lib.org/index.html) may be the least 
known. It is worth noting it a great library that impacts both the quality and 
performance of our graphs in R thanks to the new graphic devices it brings 
through the lower-level [AGG](https://antigrain.com/) library.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages

library(ggtext)
library(ragg)

# Set ggplot theme
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_family = "Atlantis", base_size = 13))

# Load and prepare the dataset
***

Today we are going to visualize world records for the Mario Kart 64 game. The 
game consists of 16 individual tracks and world records can be achieved for 
the fastest *single lap* or the fastest completed race (**three laps**).
Also, through the years, players discovered **shortcuts** in many of the tracks. 
Fortunately, shortcut and non-shortcut world records are listed separately.

Our chart consists of a double-dumbbell plot where we visualize world record 
times on Mario Kart 64 with and without shortcuts. The original source of the 
data is [https://mkwrs.com/](https://mkwrs.com/), which holds time trial world 
records for all of the Mario Kart games, but we are using the version released for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) 
initiative on the week of 2021-05-25. You can find the original announcement and
more information about the data [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-05-25).

```{r}
df_records <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-05-25/records.csv')
```

<br>

From all the columns in the data, we only use `track`, `type`, `shortcut`, `date`, 
and `time`. `track` indicates the name of the track, `type` tells us whether 
the record is for single lap or a complete race, `shortcut` is a yes/no variable 
that identifies records where a shortcut was used, `date` represents the date 
where the record was achieved, and `time` indicates how many seconds it took to 
complete the track. 

On this occasion, we only keep records for complete races. We start by 
creating `df_rank`, a data frame that keeps current world records for every 
track. The two last `arrange()` and `mutate()` lines are used to convert `track` 
into an ordered factor where the order is given by the time it took to complete
the race. It will be useful when sorting tracks on the plot. 


```{r}
df_rank <- 
  df_records %>% 
  filter(type == "Three Lap") %>%  
  group_by(track) %>% 
  filter(time == min(time)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  arrange(-time) %>% 
  mutate(track = fct_inorder(track, time))
```

<br>

We also create `df_records_three` which holds all the records, no matter they 
were beaten or not. It is used to derive other data frames that are used in our 
chart.

```{r}
df_records_three <-
  df_records %>% 
  filter(type == "Three Lap") %>% 
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) %>% 
  mutate(track = factor(track, levels = levels(df_rank$track)))
```

<br>

The first data frame derived is `df_connect`. This one is used to add a dotted
line that connects record times with and without shortcuts.

```{r}
df_connect <- 
  df_records_three %>% 
  group_by(track, type, shortcut) %>% 
  summarize(no = min(time), yes = max(time)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(track, type, shortcut),
    names_to = "record", 
    values_to = "time"
  ) %>% 
  # The line goes from the first record without shortcut (the slower)
  # to the most recent record with shortcut (the fastest)
  filter((shortcut == "No" & record == "no") | (shortcut == "Yes" & record == "yes")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(track), values_from = time, names_from = record)
```

<br>

Then we have `df_longdist` and `df_shortcut`. Without getting much into the 
details, we note each data frame consists of five columns: `track`, `year`, 
`max`, `min` and `diff`. `year` refers to the year where the current record 
was achieved, `max` is the completetion time for the first record and `min` 
is the time for the current record. `diff` is simply the difference between 
`max` and `min`, i.e. a measurement of how much the first record was improved.
`df_shortcut` and `df_longdist` refer to records with and without shortcuts,
respectively.

```{r}
df_longdist <- 
  df_records_three %>% 
  filter(shortcut == "No") %>% 
  group_by(track) %>% 
  filter(time == min(time) | time == max(time)) %>% 
  mutate(group = if_else(time == min(time), "min", "max")) %>% 
  group_by(track, group) %>%
  arrange(time) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  group_by(track) %>% 
  mutate(year = max(year)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(track, year), values_from = time, names_from = group) %>% 
  mutate(diff = max - min) 

df_shortcut <- 
  df_records_three %>% 
  filter(shortcut == "Yes") %>% 
  group_by(track) %>% 
  filter(time == min(time) | time == max(time)) %>% 
  mutate(group = if_else(time == min(time), "min", "max")) %>% 
  group_by(track, group) %>%
  arrange(time) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  group_by(track) %>% 
  mutate(year = max(year)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(track, year), values_from = time, names_from = group) %>% 
  mutate(diff = max - min)
```

## Plot
***

In this case, our lollipop plot consists of several overlapped geoms.
As always there's intentional overlap in a plot, we add what we want to remain 
on the background first.

```{r}
# This dataset `df_shorcut` and the aesthetics `aes(min, track)` are used
# in the `geom_*` calls when they are not explicitly specified.
p <- df_shortcut %>% 
  ggplot(aes(min, track)) +
  # Dotted line connection shortcut yes/no
  # This geom uses `df_connect` instead of `df_shorcut` because it is being
  # explicitly overridden
  geom_linerange(
    data = df_connect, 
    aes(xmin = yes, xmax = no, y = track), 
    inherit.aes = FALSE, 
    color = "grey75", 
    linetype = "11" # dotted line
  ) +
  # Segment when shortcut==yes
  # When the `data` argument is missing in the `geom_*` function
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = min, xmax = max, color = diff), size = 2) +
  # Segment when shortcut==no. Overlapped lineranges.
  geom_linerange(data = df_longdist, aes(xmin = min, xmax = max, color = diff), size = 2) +
  geom_linerange(data = df_longdist, aes(xmin = min, xmax = max), color = "#FFFCFC", size = .8)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  here::here("img", "lollipop-plot-with-r-mario-kart-64-world-records-preview1.png"),
  width = 7990, height = 5200, res = 500, device = agg_png, limitsize = FALSE
)
```

<center>
![](img/lollipop-plot-with-r-mario-kart-64-world-records-preview1.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

While there's a lot we still have to customize yet, this preview lets us see 
that the white center in the lines is used to differentiate records without 
shortcuts from those records with shortcuts. The same logic is used in the next 
chunk to add dots representing the first and last world records for each modality.

```{r}
p <- p +
  # Point when shortcut==yes ‚Äì first record
  geom_point(aes(x = max), size = 7, color = "#FFFCFC", fill = "grey65", shape = 21, stroke = .7) +
  # Point when shortcut==yes ‚Äì latest record. 
  geom_point(aes(fill = year), size = 7, color = "#FFFCFC", shape = 21, stroke = .7) +
  # Point when shortcut==no ‚Äì first record. 
  geom_point(data = df_longdist, aes(fill = year), size = 5.6, shape = 21, 
             color = "#FFFCFC", stroke = .5) +
  geom_point(data = df_longdist, size = 3, color = "#FFFCFC") +
  # Point when shortcut==no ‚Äì latest record
  geom_point(data = df_longdist, aes(x = max), size = 5.6, shape = 21, 
             fill = "grey65", color = "#FFFCFC", stroke = .5) +
  geom_point(data = df_longdist, aes(x = max), size = 3, color = "#FFFCFC")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  here::here("img", "lollipop-plot-with-r-mario-kart-64-world-records-preview2.png"),
  width = 7990, height = 5200, res = 500, device = agg_png, limitsize = FALSE
)
```

And it is now clear that records without shortcuts are represented by geoms with 
white centers. Let's keep improving the appearence of the chart. Now it's the 
turn to customize labels and legends, and add some informative text.

First, add the track labels with `geom_label()`. We need to make two calls 
because some tracks don't have any record without shortcuts and so their names 
are taken from the `df_longdist` data frame. Next, `geom_text()` is used  four
times to label the four different types of dots and tell the reader what they 
meaning. This is a very nice approach to include information on a plot without 
a legend.


```{r}
p <- p + 
  ## labels tracks
  geom_label(aes(label = track), family = "Atlantis", size = 6.6, hjust = 1, nudge_x = -7,
             label.size = 0, fill = "#FFFCFC") +
  geom_label(data = filter(df_longdist, !track %in% unique(df_shortcut$track)), 
             aes(label = track), family = "Atlantis", size = 6.6, hjust = 1, nudge_x = -7,
             label.size = 0, fill = "#FFFCFC") +
  ## labels dots when shortcut==yes
  geom_text(data = filter(df_shortcut, track == "Wario Stadium"),
             aes(label = "Most recent record\nwith shortcuts"), 
             family = "Overpass", size = 3.5, color = "#4a5a7b", 
             lineheight = .8, vjust = 0, nudge_y = .4) +
  geom_text(data = filter(df_shortcut, track == "Wario Stadium"),
             aes(x = max, label = "First record\nwith shortcuts"), 
             family = "Overpass", size = 3.5, color = "grey50", 
             lineheight = .8, vjust = 0, nudge_y = .4) +
  ## labels dots when shortcut==no
  geom_text(data = filter(df_longdist, track == "Wario Stadium"),
             aes(label = "Most recent record\nw/o shortcuts"), 
             family = "Overpass", size = 3.5, color = "#4a5a7b", lineheight = .8, 
             vjust = 0, nudge_x = -7, nudge_y = .4) +
  geom_text(data = filter(df_longdist, track == "Wario Stadium"),
             aes(x = max, label = "First record\nw/o shortcuts"), 
             family = "Overpass", size = 3.5, color = "grey50", lineheight = .8, 
             vjust = 0, nudge_x = 7, nudge_y = .4)
```

<br>

Then it's the time to tweak scales and axis.

```{r}
p <- p + 
  # Extend horizontal axis so trackl labels fit
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-60, 400)) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0, 400, by = 50), 
    # Add 'seconds' label only to first axis tick
    labels = function(x) ifelse(x == 0, paste(x, "seconds"), paste(x)),
    sec.axis = dup_axis(), # Add axis ticks and labels both on top and bottom.
    expand = c(.02, .02)
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(.07, .07)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#b4d1d2", high = "#242c3c", name = "Year of Record") +
  rcartocolor::scale_color_carto_c(
    palette = "RedOr", 
    limits = c(0, 250),
    name = "Time difference between first and most recent record"
  )
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  here::here("img", "lollipop-plot-with-r-mario-kart-64-world-records-preview3.png"),
  width = 7990, height = 5200, res = 500, device = agg_png, limitsize = FALSE
)
```

<center>
![](img/lollipop-plot-with-r-mario-kart-64-world-records-preview3.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>


Some touches to the position of the guides and their size...

```{r}
p <- p + 
  guides(
    fill = guide_legend(title.position = "left"),
    color = guide_colorbar(
      barwidth = unit(.45, "lines"),
      barheight = unit(22, "lines"),
      title.position = "left"
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Let's-a-Go!  You  May  Still  Have  Chances  to  Grab  a  New  World  Record  for  Mario  Kart  64",
    subtitle = "Most world records for Mario Kart 64 were achieved pretty recently (13 in 2020, 10 in 2021). On several tracks, the players considerably improved the time needed to complete three laps when they used shortcuts (*Choco Mountain*, *D.K.'s Jungle Parkway*, *Frappe Snowland*, *Luigi Raceway*, *Rainbow Road*, *Royal Raceway*, *Toad's Turnpike*, *Wario Stadium*, and *Yoshi Valley*). Actually, for three out of these tracks the previous records were more than halved since 2020 (*Luigi Raceway*, *Rainbow Road*, and *Toad's Turnpike*). Four other tracks still have no records for races with shortcuts (*Moo Moo Farm*, *Koopa Troopa Beach*, *Banshee Boardwalk*, and *Bowser's Castle*). Are there none or did nobody find them yet? Pretty unrealistic given the fact that since more than 24 years the game is played all around the world‚Äîbut maybe you're able to find one and obtain a new world record?",
    caption = "Visualization: C√©dric Scherer  ‚Ä¢  Data: mkwrs.com/mk64"
  )
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  here::here("img", "lollipop-plot-with-r-mario-kart-64-world-records.png"),
  width = 7990, height = 5200, res = 500, device = agg_png, limitsize = FALSE
)
```


<br>

<center>
![](img/lollipop-plot-with-r-mario-kart-64-world-records.png){width=90%}
</center>

And finally, save the plot. `device = agg_png` means we use the PNG graphic 
device from the AGG backend previously mentioned instead of the default PNG 
backend that comes with a typical installation of R.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(
  here::here("img", "lollipop-plot-with-r-mario-kart-64-world-records.png"),
  width = 7990, height = 5200, res = 500, device = agg_png, limitsize = FALSE
)
