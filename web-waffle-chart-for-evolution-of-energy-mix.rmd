# About

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today, we will be creating a [waffle chart](https://r-graph-gallery.com/waffle.html) to show the **relative (proportional) change of the consumption of primary energy sources in France since 1960.**

This plot was heavily inspired by Muhammad Azhar's [waffle plot on the R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/web-waffle-for-time-evolution.html).

It is the work of [Guillaume Noblet](https://rehpere.org/en/guillaume-noblet). Huge thanks to him for sharing his work here! Thanks also to Soeun Kim who helped integrate this tutorial to the gallery!

As a teaser, this is the chart we'll be making:

# Load packages

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We begin by loading the necessary packages for data manipulation and visualization. These include `rio` to download a csv file from Our World in Data (we could also use the API or the R package `owidapi` ), `data.table` for data wrangling, [`ggplot2`](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) for you know what, [`waffle`](https://r-graph-gallery.com/waffle.html) for the waffle geometry, and [`ggtext`](https://r-graph-gallery.com/package/ggtext.html) and [`patchwork`](https://r-graph-gallery.com/package/patchwork.html) for text annotations and layout.

::: callout-tip
Btw, usually I use `rig`, `renv`, and `box` to manage the versioning of R and R packages and for importing functions.
:::

```{r}
library(rio) # for importing data
library(data.table) # for data wrangling
library(forcats) # to recode to factor
library(ggplot2) # for data visualization
library(waffle) # to get the waffle geometrz
library(ggtext) # to add text annotations
library(patchwork) # to combine plots
library(showtext) # to get fonts
```

For a sidenote, since [`waffle`](https://r-graph-gallery.com/waffle.html) package has been removed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/waffle/index.html), you can install directly from GitHub by typing `remotes::install_github("hrbrmstr/waffle")`.

# Wrangle data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As said above, we want to plot a [waffle chart](https://r-graph-gallery.com/waffle.html) to display the relative (proportional) change of the consumption of primary energy sources in France since 1960. For instance, a [stacked bar chart](https://r-graph-gallery.com/barplot.html) would be fine too, although it is harder to compare for a given year, aka hard to grasp exact percentages in the blink of an eye. Yet, a waffle a year would be overwhelming too, so let's prepare data to get the **sum of consumption per decade.**

::: callout-note
At the time this post is written, for the 2020 decade, proportions accounts for years 2020-2024 (not a full decade).
:::

So, we import energy consumption data from Our World in Data and convert it into a `data.table` for data wrangling. I define a helper function to round years down to the nearest decade. This helps group data into 10-year intervals. Now, we filter the data to include only France since 1960 and sum the consumption by energy source for each decade.

::: callout-tip
To round years to the nearest decade, we can remove the modulo division of the year by 10, i.e., use the `%%` modulo operator dividing by 10, and it takes precedence over the `-` operator.
:::

```{r}
# import 
dat <- import("https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/owid-public/data/energy/owid-energy-data.csv")
setDT(dat)

# function to round down to the nearest decade
round_to_decade <- function(year) {
  return(year - year %% 10)
}

# sum consumption for france by source, every 10 years from 1900 to 2020
dat_sum <- dat[
    year >= 1960 & country == "France", 
    lapply(.SD, function(x) sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    .SDcols = c("biofuel_consumption", "coal_consumption", "gas_consumption", 
               "hydro_consumption", "nuclear_consumption", "oil_consumption", 
               "other_renewable_consumption", "solar_consumption", "wind_consumption"),
    by = .(country, decade = round_to_decade(year))
]
```

Some final data wrangling is needed---or at least welcomed!

-   transform the data to long format to facilitate plotting;

-   calculate the percentage of each source within a decade;

-   convert percentages to integers that add up to 100 per decade;

-   add an 's' to 'decade' to avoid misleading readers.

```{r}
# pivot longer
dat_sum <- melt(dat_sum, id.vars = c("country", "decade"))
# consumption per year as perc of total
dat_sum[, perc := (value / sum(value)) * 100, by = .(country, decade)]
# remove NA
dat_sum <- na.omit(dat_sum, cols = "perc")
# ensure sum=100 for each decade
dat_sum <- dat_sum[, perc_int := as.integer(round(perc))][,
  perc_int := {
    current_sum <- sum(perc_int)
    if (current_sum != 100) {
      diff <- 100 - current_sum
      perc_int[which.max(value)] <- perc_int[which.max(value)] + diff
    }
    perc_int
  }, by = decade][
  perc_int > 0
]
# year to character with an s for decade
dat_sum[, decade_chr := paste0(as.character(decade), "s")] 
```

# Time to plot

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first questions I had thought about when I saw the data were: (1) if I were to display energy sources as fill colors, should I display all of them?, and (2) if yes, how to try out to represent these with colors that may represent the energy source for the reader (and myself as a reader).

So I first did some research, aka I DuckDuckGo-ed [Petrol color](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=petrol+color&t=h_&iar=images) and [Nuclear Uranium color](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=nuclear+uranium+color&t=h_&iar=images). With a bit of back and forth and some trials and errors (and disagreement with the DuckDuckGo results)---e.g., when two colors for two energy sources were too close---, I got to the below colors, and then factored the energy sources data.

```{r}
# legend of energy
energy_sources <- c(
  "Coal" = "coal_consumption",
  "Oil" = "oil_consumption",
  "Gas" = "gas_consumption",
  "Hydro" = "hydro_consumption",
  "Nuclear" = "nuclear_consumption",
  "Biofuel" = "biofuel_consumption",
  "Solar" = "solar_consumption",
  "Wind" = "wind_consumption",
  "Other Renewables" = "other_renewable_consumption"
)
energy_colors = c(
  "Coal" = "#444239FF",
  "Oil" = "#035F72FF",
  "Gas" = "#D77186FF",
  "Hydro" = "#A4B7E1FF",
  "Nuclear" = "#E69F00",
  "Biofuel" = "#B0986CFF",
  "Solar" = "#F8D564FF",
  "Wind" = "#56B4E9",
  "Other Renewables" = "#1BB6AFFF"
)

# add levels and order by energy_sources
dat_sum <- dat_sum[,
  variable := factor(
    fct_recode(variable, !!!energy_sources),
    levels = names(energy_sources)
  )
]
setorder(dat_sum, decade, variable)
```

Onto the [`waffle chart`](https://r-graph-gallery.com/waffle.html). The base plot is a simple waffle chart with **facets per decade** and a **fill colors per energy source**. Since I want the waffle chart to somewhat be a **time series chart**, I use only one row with a strip text at the bottom for the facets, and 5 blocks/squares per row (hence the y-scale must be modified).

```{r}
g <- ggplot(dat_sum, aes(fill = variable, values = perc_int)) +
    geom_waffle(
        color = "white", 
        size = 0.2, 
        n_rows = 5, 
        flip = TRUE,
        make_proportional = FALSE
    ) +
    # since 
    facet_wrap(
        ~decade_chr,
        nrow = 1, 
        strip.position = "bottom"
    ) +
    scale_x_discrete() + 
    scale_y_continuous(
        labels = function(x) x * 5,
        expand = c(0,0)) + 
    scale_fill_manual(
        values = energy_colors, 
        breaks = names(energy_sources), 
        name = "Energy Source", 
        drop = FALSE
    )
g
```

Next, let's refine the layout by adding some **titles, and font and theming options.** For the subtitle, I add color-coded references to the energy sources, so it serves as a legend (maybe a legend would still be needed though?).

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}

# and html string
subtitle_text <- glue::glue(
  "
    In the 1960s, only <span style='color:{energy_colors['Coal']};'><strong>coal</strong></span>, 
    <span style='color:{energy_colors['Oil']};'><strong>oil</strong></span>, 
    <span style='color:{energy_colors['Gas']};'><strong>gas</strong></span>, and 
    <span style='color:{energy_colors['Hydro']};'><strong>hydro</strong></span> 
    were part of the French energetic mix. By the 2020s, 
    <span style='color:{energy_colors['Nuclear']};'><strong>nuclear</strong></span> 
    energy grew to account for almost 40%, and other sources appeared such as 
    <span style='color:{energy_colors['Biofuel']};'><strong>biofuel</strong></span>, 
    <span style='color:{energy_colors['Solar']};'><strong>solar</strong></span>, 
    <span style='color:{energy_colors['Wind']};'><strong>wind</strong></span>, and 
    <span style='color:{energy_colors['Other Renewables']};'><strong>other renewable energy</strong></span>. 
    While proportions help illustrate the balance between different energy sources,
    they hide the significant overall increase in consumption.

            width = unit(0.9, "npc")
        ),
        plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(
            hjust = 0, 
            margin = margin(10, 0, 40, 0),
            width = unit(0.9, "npc"),
            size = 14,

        ),

        plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20)
    ) 
g
```

To wrap up this plot, let's add one **annotation** to stress out the singular French context on nuclear energy and this surging proportion. I add here the arrow as a `geom_curve` onto the 1970s facet and then add the text with `geom_richtext` over the whole plot using [`patchwork`](https://r-graph-gallery.com/package/patchwork.html). Other options are possible (and most likely more efficient ones).

```{r}
g <- g +
    geom_curve(
        data = data.frame(x = 3.9, y = 21, xend = 4.9, yend = 24, decade_chr = "1970s"),
        aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),
        arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.03, "npc")),
        curvature = -0.3,
        color = "black",
        inherit.aes = FALSE
    )

```

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}

g <- g + inset_element(
  ggplot() +
    geom_richtext(
      aes(
        x = 0.30,
        y = 0.55,
        label = "<span style='font-size:15px;'>In 1973, nuclear power was 8% of<br>the production of French electricity.</span>"
      ),
      fill = NA,
      label.color = NA,
      vjust = 0,
      hjust = 0,
      family = body_font
    ) +
    theme_void() +
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1), expand = FALSE),
  left = 0, right = 1, bottom = 0, top = 1, align_to = 'full'
)
g
```

And here is the final result! A simple annotation makes the chart much more reader-friendly!
